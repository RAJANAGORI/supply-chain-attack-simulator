## Part 1: Understanding Version Confusion (15 minutes)

### What Is Version Confusion?

**Version confusion** occurs when a package manager's resolver selects an **unintended version**—often the **highest** semver match—because of loose ranges, weak registry policy, or attacker-published absurd versions.

**Classic pattern in this lab**:
```
Registry contains:
  version-confuser-lib@1.0.1   (benign)
  version-confuser-lib@999.999.999   (malicious)

Victim range: "*" or "highest wins"
Resolver picks: 999.999.999  ← attacker wins
```

### How Semver Resolution Works

Semver compares major.minor.patch numerically:
```
1.0.1  <  999.999.999
```

When a range like `*` or a loose caret allows any version, the resolver typically selects the **maximum** satisfying version. Attackers exploit this by publishing implausibly high versions.

### Version Confusion vs Dependency Confusion

| Aspect | Version Confusion (this lab) | Dependency Confusion (Scenario 2) |
|--------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Mechanism** | Same package name, higher semver | Public registry wins over private scope |
| **Registry** | Local/custom registry layout | Public npm vs internal Artifactory |
| **Range trigger** | `*`, loose semver | Missing scope + public typosquat |
| **Attacker action** | Publish `999.x` version | Publish same name on public registry |

Both abuse **trust in the resolver**—but the root cause and fix differ.

### Visual Example

```
registry/
└── version-confuser-lib/
    ├── 1.0.1/          ← Expected benign release
    │   ├── index.js
    │   └── package.json
    └── 999.999.999/    ← Malicious high version
        ├── index.js    ← Exfiltrates on load
        └── package.json

victim-app/
├── index.js            ← Simulates resolver (picks highest)
└── installed-version.json   ← Records what was chosen
```

### Why Version Confusion Is Risky

1. **Silent upgrade**: Teams expect `1.x` but get `999.x`
2. **Range permissiveness**: `*` and broad carets hide the risk
3. **Registry sprawl**: Multiple registries increase precedence bugs
4. **CI automation**: Unpinned CI installs pull latest attacker version nightly
5. **Low attacker cost**: One malicious version publish, many victims

### Real-World Context

- **Malicious high semver** on public registries
- **Custom registries** where internal and external versions collide
- **`latest` tag abuse** and dist-tag manipulation
- **Automated renovate/dependabot** pulling unexpected majors without review

**The Attack Chain**:
```
npm install / npm start
    └── Resolver lists all versions in registry/
            └── Sorts semver → picks 999.999.999
                    └── Malicious code loads → exfil to :3020
```

---

## Part 2: Prerequisites Check (5 minutes)

Before we start, make sure you've completed:

- ✅ Scenario 1 (Typosquatting) — Package naming attacks
- ✅ Scenario 2 (Dependency Confusion) — Registry precedence
- ✅ Node.js 16+ and npm installed
- ✅ TESTBENCH_MODE enabled

Verify your setup:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
echo $TESTBENCH_MODE  # Should output: enabled
```

---

## Part 3: Setting Up Scenario 20 (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Navigate to Scenario Directory

```bash
cd scenarios/20-package-version-confusion
```

### Step 2: Run the Setup Script

```bash
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
./setup.sh
```

**What this does:**
- Prepares mock server on port **3020**
- Initializes `captured-data.json`
- Clears `victim-app/node_modules` for clean resolution
- Prints Terminal A / Terminal B instructions

### Step 3: Understand the Environment

**The Scenario Structure**:
```
20-package-version-confusion/
├── registry/
│   └── version-confuser-lib/
│       ├── 1.0.1/              # Benign version
│       └── 999.999.999/        # Malicious high version
├── victim-app/
│   ├── index.js                # Resolver simulation
│   ├── installed-version.json  # Written at runtime
│   └── package.json
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── mock-server.js          # Port 3020
│   └── captured-data.json
└── detection-tools/
    └── version-confusion-detector.js
```

---

## Part 4: Understanding the Registry Layout (20 minutes)

### Step 1: List Available Versions

```bash
ls -la registry/version-confuser-lib/
```

**Expected directories:**
- `1.0.1` — legitimate release
- `999.999.999` — attacker-controlled high version

### Step 2: Compare Benign vs Malicious Packages

```bash
cat registry/version-confuser-lib/1.0.1/package.json
cat registry/version-confuser-lib/1.0.1/index.js
```

**Benign behavior**: Returns `{ ok: true, version: '1.0.1' }` without network activity.

```bash
cat registry/version-confuser-lib/999.999.999/package.json
cat registry/version-confuser-lib/999.999.999/index.js
```

**Malicious behavior** (when `TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled`):
- POSTs payload to `localhost:3020/collect` on module load
- Reports `selectedVersion: '999.999.999'`

### Step 3: Examine the Victim Resolver

```bash
cat victim-app/index.js
```

**Key logic:**
1. Lists all version directories under `registry/version-confuser-lib/`
2. Sorts by semver comparison
3. Picks **highest** version (`slice(-1)[0]`)
4. Copies chosen version into `node_modules/`
5. Requires package and writes `installed-version.json`

**Simulated risky range**: Comments note this models `"*"` meaning "take the highest."

### Step 4: Review Victim Configuration

```bash
cat victim-app/package.json
```

**Questions:**
- Are dependencies pinned to exact versions?
- Is there a lockfile enforcing resolution?
- Would `npm ci` prevent drift?

### Step 5: Walk Through the Semver Comparator

The victim app implements a simplified semver sort:

```bash
grep -A 15 "function compareSemver" victim-app/index.js
```

**Try mentally sorting these** (as the resolver would):
```
1.0.1  vs  1.0.2   → 1.0.2 wins
1.9.9  vs  2.0.0   → 2.0.0 wins
1.0.1  vs  999.999.999  → 999.999.999 wins  ← attack wins
```

**Key Point**: Without an upper bound in your range policy, any published high version becomes "valid."

### Step 6: Document Expected vs Actual

Before running the attack, predict the outcome:

| Question | Your prediction | After lab |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Which version should a cautious team want? | `1.0.1` | |
| Which version does "highest wins" select? | | |
| Will benign code exfiltrate? | | |

Fill the "After lab" column during Part 5.

## Part 5: The Attack - Highest Version Wins (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Understand the Attack Timeline

**Scenario**: Attacker publishes `version-confuser-lib@999.999.999` to a registry the victim uses. Loose semver policy causes resolver to prefer it over `1.0.1`.

**Attack Timeline**:
1. Attacker publishes implausibly high semver
2. Victim runs install/start with permissive range
3. Resolver selects `999.999.999`
4. Malicious module loads and exfiltrates to port **3020**
5. `installed-version.json` records the skew for blue team

### Step 2: Start the Mock Attacker Server

**Terminal A**:

```bash
cd scenarios/20-package-version-confusion
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
node infrastructure/mock-server.js
```

**Verify**:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3020/captured-data
```

### Step 3: Run Victim Resolution and Install

**Terminal B**:

```bash
cd scenarios/20-package-version-confusion/victim-app
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
npm start
```

**Console output includes**:
```
Available versions: 1.0.1, 999.999.999
Chosen version (highest match): 999.999.999
Installed lib run: { ok: true, version: '999.999.999' }
```

### Step 4: Inspect Resolution Evidence

```bash
cat installed-version.json
```

**Expected content**:
```json
{
  "lib": "version-confuser-lib",
  "chosenVersion": "999.999.999",
  "timestamp": "..."
}
```

```bash
# Confirm malicious code path in node_modules
cat node_modules/version-confuser-lib/package.json | grep version
```

### Step 5: Observe Exfiltration

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3020/captured-data | jq
```

**Captured fields**:
- `attack`: `package-version-confusion`
- `selectedVersion`: `999.999.999`
- `hostname`, `cwd`, `timestamp`

```bash
cat ../infrastructure/captured-data.json | jq '.captures[-1]'
```

### Step 6: Simulate Mitigation — Pin Exact Version (Optional)

Conceptually, pinning `1.0.1` would prevent the attack:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "version-confuser-lib": "1.0.1"
}
```

In this lab the resolver simulation always picks highest from registry folders—but the **lesson** applies directly to real npm semver ranges.

---

## Part 6: Detection Methods (40 minutes)

### Detection Method 1: Version Confusion Detector

From scenario root:

```bash
cd scenarios/20-package-version-confusion
node detection-tools/version-confusion-detector.js victim-app
```

**What this flags:**
- Suspicious high versions in `installed-version.json`
- Loose semver ranges in `package.json`
- Pinning gaps that enable resolver abuse

### Detection Method 2: Manual Version Audit

```bash
cd victim-app

cat installed-version.json | jq

# Check for absurd semver jumps
node -e "
  const j = require('./installed-version.json');
  const v = j.chosenVersion || '';
  if (v.startsWith('999')) console.log('ALERT: suspicious high version', v);
"
```

### Detection Method 3: Registry Inspection

```bash
ls ../registry/version-confuser-lib/

# In production: audit registry for unexpected high versions
# npm view package-name versions --json
```

### Detection Method 4: Lockfile Enforcement

```bash
# After npm install, lockfile should freeze resolution
test -f package-lock.json && echo "Lockfile present" || echo "NO LOCKFILE — risky"
```

**Policy**: CI must use `npm ci` and fail if lockfile missing or outdated.

### Detection Method 5: Dependency Range Audit

```bash
cd victim-app

# Find wildcard or loose ranges in package.json
node -e "
  const p = require('./package.json');
  const deps = { ...p.dependencies, ...p.devDependencies };
  Object.entries(deps || {}).forEach(([name, range]) => {
    if (range === '*' || range.startsWith('^') || range.startsWith('~'))
      console.log('LOOSE:', name, range);
  });
"
```

**Production policy examples**:
- Block `*` in production `package.json` via lint rule
- Require exact pins for packages tagged `critical` in asset inventory
- Fail CI if lockfile resolution differs from pinned manifest

### Detection Method 6: Sigma and IOC Hunting

**IOCs from `DETECT.md`**:
- Implausibly high resolved version (`999.x`)
- Loose semver range enabling precedence abuse
- Beacons to `127.0.0.1:3020`

**Sample log**:
```json
{"scenario_id":"20","event_type":"version_confusion_resolution","resolved_version":"999.0.0","destination":"127.0.0.1:3020"}
```

**YARA-like strings**: `installed-version.json`, `999.`, `3020`

---

## Part 7: Forensic Investigation (30 minutes)

### Investigation Step 1: Resolution Reconstruction

```bash
cd scenarios/20-package-version-confusion/victim-app

# What versions existed?
ls ../registry/version-confuser-lib/

# What was chosen?
cat installed-version.json

# Resolver logic
head -60 index.js
```

### Investigation Step 2: Package Content Analysis

```bash
cat node_modules/version-confuser-lib/index.js
```

**Questions:**
- Does installed code match expected version's source?
- When was malicious version published (in real incidents: registry metadata)?
- Who approved the semver range that allowed selection?

### Investigation Step 3: Impact Assessment

```bash
# If this were a monorepo, which apps share the dependency?
grep -r "version-confuser-lib" . 2>/dev/null
```

**Questions:**
- How many projects use loose ranges on this package?
- Did CI builds across the org pull `999.x`?
- What secrets exist in processes that `require()` this library?

### Investigation Step 4: Timeline

```bash
cat ../infrastructure/captured-data.json | jq '.captures[] | {timestamp, version: .data.selectedVersion}'
stat installed-version.json
```

---

## Part 8: Incident Response & Mitigation (30 minutes)

### Response Step 1: Immediate Containment

```bash
# Stop victim processes
../../scripts/kill-port.sh 3020

# Remove malicious resolution
cd victim-app
rm -rf node_modules
rm -f installed-version.json
```

### Response Step 2: Pin and Reinstall

```bash
# In production: pin exact version in package.json
# "version-confuser-lib": "1.0.1"

rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
# Re-run with patched policy / scoped registry
```

### Response Step 3: Long-term Defenses

1. **Pin exact versions** for critical dependencies — no `*` or unbounded carets
2. **Enforce lockfiles** — `npm ci` only in CI; reject installs without lockfile
3. **Registry firewall** — block absurd semver from untrusted publishers
4. **Scoped private packages** — explicit registry mapping for internal names
5. **Version jump alerts** — flag major or numeric anomalies (e.g. `999.x`)
6. **Human review** — require approval for dependency version bumps above threshold

```bash
# CI gate example
node detection-tools/version-confusion-detector.js victim-app
```

## Mitigation Playbook

Canonical prevention and mitigation controls (aligned with the [scenario README](../../../scenarios/20-package-version-confusion/README.md)). Lab walkthroughs above expand each control with hands-on steps.

- Pin exact versions for critical dependencies and enforce lockfile usage.
- Scope private packages explicitly to internal registry endpoints.
- Alert on unusual semver jumps and first-seen maintainers.
- Require human review for dependency version changes above policy thresholds.
- Prefer deterministic `npm ci` workflows in CI.

---

## Elasticsearch + Kibana observability (optional)

Scenario **20 — Package Version Confusion** is indexed in Elasticsearch when the observability stack is running.

Version confusion: semver picks version-confuser-lib 999.999.999 over the expected 1.x release.

- **Detection runbook (static)** → index `scas-rules`, document id `20` — IOCs, Sigma, YARA, sample logs from `DETECT.md`
- **Runtime captures (dynamic)** → index `scas-detections` — one document per exfil event when `SCAS_ES_URL` is set before starting the mock collector

### How to read this diagram

| Phase | What you should look for |
|-------|--------------------------|
| **1 — Collectors** | Terminal A starts the mock server (or harvester). Set `SCAS_ES_URL` here if you want live Elasticsearch indexing. |
| **2 — Lab execution** | Terminal B runs the scenario README steps. Numbered arrows follow the attack path in order. |
| **3 — Exfiltration** | Malicious sample sends **localhost-only** JSON to the mock endpoint. Evidence is always written to `infrastructure/` on disk. |
| **4 — Elasticsearch** | When `SCAS_ES_URL` is set, the same capture is indexed into `scas-detections` with `scenario_id` and `event_type=exfil_capture`. |
| **5 — Kibana** | Use the per-scenario saved searches to compare **runtime captures** (Detections) with the **static runbook** (Rules). |

> **Safety:** All network calls stay on `127.0.0.1`. Malicious logic runs only when `TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled`.

### Prerequisites

From the repository root:

```bash
./scripts/elasticsearch-up.sh
./scripts/setup-kibana-data-views.sh   # data views + saved searches for all 22 scenarios
```

### Run this scenario with live Elasticsearch forwarding

**Terminal A — mock collector** (from `scenarios/20-package-version-confusion`):

```bash
cd scenarios/20-package-version-confusion
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
export SCAS_ES_URL=http://localhost:9200
node infrastructure/mock-server.js
```

**Terminal B — execute the lab:**

```bash
cd scenarios/20-package-version-confusion
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
export SCAS_ES_URL=http://localhost:9200
cd victim-app && npm install && npm start
```

### Verify locally (file-based evidence)

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3020/captured-data
```

### Verify in Elasticsearch (API)

```bash
# Static runbook for this scenario
curl -s "http://localhost:9200/scas-rules/_doc/20?pretty"

# Latest runtime capture events
curl -s "http://localhost:9200/scas-detections/_search?pretty" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "query": { "term": { "scenario_id": "20" } },
    "sort": [{ "@timestamp": "desc" }],
    "size": 5
  }'
```

### Verify in Kibana (UI)

1. Open [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601)
2. **Discover** → **SCAS Detections — Scenario 20** — live capture timeline (`@timestamp`, `package.name`, `detail`)
3. **Discover** → **SCAS Rules — Scenario 20** — compare against `iocs`, `sigma`, and `yara` fields
4. Ask: *Does each capture field match an IOC or Sigma condition in the runbook?*

See [observability/README.md](../../../observability/README.md) for stack details.

## Part 9: Key Takeaways

### Why Version Confusion Is Dangerous

1. **Resolver trust**: Teams assume semver picks "reasonable" versions
2. **Silent malicious upgrade**: No typosquat needed—same name, higher number
3. **Automation amplification**: CI nightly installs spread bad resolution fast
4. **Detection difficulty**: Installed package name looks correct
5. **Combined with confusion**: Public/private registry issues compound semver abuse

### Best Practices

1. ✅ **Pin exact versions** for production-critical deps
2. ✅ **Commit and enforce lockfiles** with `npm ci`
3. ✅ **Scope internal packages** to private registries explicitly
4. ✅ **Alert on semver anomalies** — first-seen maintainers, `999.x` jumps
5. ✅ **Review dependency PRs** — treat version bumps as security events
6. ✅ **Registry controls** — block publishing above policy max without approval
7. ✅ **Distinguish attack types** — version vs dependency confusion need different controls

### Real-World Impact

- **Wide CI exposure**: Every unpinned pipeline pulls malicious highest version
- **Delayed detection**: Package name matches expectation; version does not
- **Remediation**: Lockfile regeneration, registry takedown requests, org-wide pin audit

---

## Part 10: Advanced Exercises

### Exercise 1: Pinning Tradeoff
- Rewrite one `package.json` dependency from `*` to an exact pinned version and explain the tradeoff (security vs patch agility)

### Exercise 2: Attack Comparison
- Describe how dependency confusion (public vs private) differs from this lab's "highest local version" simulation
- Which control catches each earliest?

### Exercise 3: CI Semver Gate
- Design a policy that blocks semver `> 100.0.0` without human approval
- Outline telemetry needed to detect version confusion at scale

### Exercise 4: Registry Forensics
- Given `installed-version.json` and registry folder layout, write an IR report section explaining root cause and blast radius

## ⚠️ Safety & Ethics

**IMPORTANT**: This scenario is for **educational purposes only**.

- ✅ Use ONLY in isolated test environments
- ✅ Never publish malicious high-version packages to real registries
- ✅ All malicious behavior requires `TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled`
- ✅ Exfiltration targets **127.0.0.1:3020** only — no real external C2
- ✅ Version confusion is simulated with a local registry layout

---

**Remember**: Loose semver ranges are an open invitation. Pin versions, enforce lockfiles, and treat resolver output as untrusted until verified!

🔐 Happy Learning!
